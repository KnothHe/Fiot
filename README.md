## Note

Because I want to use CJK text,
I have set a font that supports CJK text Under the font directory.

You could specify the font to use, if the default font is not displayed

## TODO

- [x] image on image (fii) command line parser
- [x] combine two programs, though it is very ugly now
- [ ] add set background color argument
- [ ] add whether loop text argument

## License

Though it is so tiny and may not good, it still has a licence.

The project is released under the MIT License.

## Off topic

I don't know much about Python, so the code may not be very good.

At the same time, I am not sure whether the use of Noto font is infringing.
If so, please let me know and I will delete it.
